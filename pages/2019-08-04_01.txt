For long now I haven't written on my blog,
partly because i maintain the hypothesis that in what i want to write about -which is nature-
there are simply no secrets for me to spoil.
If you're interested in how physics works, then just sit and observe: i don't need to explain it:
it's all obvious once you actually *try* to understand it -just that most people don't actually really care-.
If you're not interested in physics, however, then it's pointless for me to try and explain.
So either way there's not much point in explaining -i thought-, so why do it then?
This has kept me away from publishing much in the recent past.

Now, however, i'm having different thoughts:
While i still believe that those interested in physics do not need much of an explanation,
i also believe now that words serve a different purpose, too:
Words are not so much intended in order to spread "knowledge" (whatever that may be),
but rather to express identification with a certain language (and as we know, a language always comes with a culture and a community).
As we're using a certain language, we're identifying ourselves as part of a certain community.
The community of "scientists" might be one such example that one can identify with -which is not so much what i want-,
but instead i'd like to (by my language, and my wordings) identify with a certain other community (which, unfortunately, i do not know the name for).

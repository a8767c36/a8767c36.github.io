While the penis doesn't care about which person's hole it's put into, well, the mind does.
That's why I call it "The Monogamy of the Mind".
The very separation of organisms into different physical bodies reflects the digitalization of nature. Binding socially to another human, then, exhibits bistability. Viewing it as a discrete optimization process is kinda dry, so I'll say instead "you're used to a special someone". That being-used-to is the origin of monogamy.

I understand, then, that to some people "a hole is a hole" and all you need to worry about is to use a condom (against pregnancy/diseases), but to me, sexuality is something way more profound, something intimate and something to not easily give out and let go. In that respect, I'm more a girl than a boy, because my understanding of intimacy is deeper than my pure desire.
That's why I like to "take it calm". I am very calm at the surface, because my urge for stability (calmness) developed into a much stronger force than my sexual desire. That's because otherwise I'd be at constant conflict with the world.

The Art of Subtle Rhetorics

It is admittedly an artform to find the right words for every situation.
But this is not what this text is all about.
When we communicate, we do so not only by our words, but also by our body language.
This way of communicating is way more subtle, that's why I call it "subtle rhetorics".

It conveys meaning opposite to that of words:
While words strive for success,
subtle rhetorics is a means of exchanging one's emotions and therefore part of one's soul.
This is why it has hardly anything to do with spoken language.
Spoken language is rational, targeted and direct,
while subtle rhetorics are more like circles:
They lead to no goal, but instead they simply exist for their own purpose.
This is why it's not something that's taught in school:
School is for making people successful in live,
not leading them in circles (although sometimes it seems so...).
Subtle rhetorics is an artform, gentle and twisted, with no other purpose than its own beauty.

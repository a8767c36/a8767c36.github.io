When I was a young boy I remember sitting on the green grass and thinking about various things.
Like, why is it that it always seems that everybody's always in a hurry.
Why don't other people sit down in the green warm grass next to me and turn up some soft music?
Why do people need to drink alcohol in order to be able to enjoy each other?
And why is it that everybody's constantly picking on me?
The more I thought about this, the less I could find a satisfying answer.
Is it because people want to spread unhappiness?

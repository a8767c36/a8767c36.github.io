Is it inpolite to stare at someone else's screen?
Well, definitely it is.
But what does that mean?

(more on that later, but first...)
Sadly, many people spend their lifetime trying to compete against others
and trying to be better than others.
While at first glance, that may seem healthy (everybody's trying to be a better person),
it has some serious side-effects.
Namely, if you're to compete against someone, there are two ways to win:
Performing well, or sabotaging the rivals.
And sadly, since the second option is admittedly easier to implement,
many people opt for that option.
From which, in total, nobody benefits.
This is not a philosophical, abstract idea,
but a very real phenomenon.
"To be better than others" is often wrongly interpreted as "others are worse than you",
which I think is a sad way of thinking.
This is why I'm not a big fan of competition in general.

Yeah, so back to the screen issue.
I was saying that many people see competition everywhere.
(You can imagine 15-y/o-puberty-girls here, but the phenomenon exists everywhere.)
So when they get a glimpse of someone else's screen and see something dubious,
(like an inappropriate Facebook-Message/Like/whatever or a filthy chat message)
it is very often used against the screen's owner.
Which, as I said, isn't productive and helpful to anyone in the end.
So society made a rule to prevent that scene altogether.

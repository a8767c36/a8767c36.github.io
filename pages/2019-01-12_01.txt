Chakra Point - "Spinning Wheel"

There are some things that just don't change. Bones are bones and not blood, and humans eat food and shit shit and don't shit food and eat shit.
Let's call them "invariants" - they don't change (they don't "vary") no matter the circumstances.
Such invariants give rise to stability (to biological systems).
Invariants are sometimes cyclic: The sun goes up and down and up and down...
Let's give that special case (which is actually more common than the simple case) a special name: "Spinning Wheel".
Translate it into "holy language" (to give it a special glamour) and voila... Chakra Points.

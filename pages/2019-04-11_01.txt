There are a few common misconceptions that we need to clear up.

"The more power you have, the better."
This is not necessarily the case.
Imagine power like knowledge.
No matter how much knowledge you have,
there will always be a computer who has more than you.
So what's the point of trying to be the best?
It's a waste of time, and frustrating on top of that.

"I care about your opinion."
No, in fact, most of the time I don't.
You don't get my attention/appreciation by talking more;
You get my respect by saying things that are worthy talking about.
(Which is up to my judgement, ofc, not yours.)
But don't be frustrated if I don't think you're interesting,
someone else probably will.
Every Jack has his Jill.

"I'm a precious human being because I work hard."
Honestly, if you source your self-esteem in the work you perform,
you have serious confidence/trust issues.
If the people can't appreciate you the moment you sit down and relax,
you should leave these assholes behind and find people who make you feel comfortable,
not pressured to do stuff.

Why the heck am I actually still writing this blog?
Do I feel inspired to write something? No.
Do I want to tell somebody something? No.
It's just this feeling of having to continue something that I once started
that makes me write yet another dumb page about gravity, physics and mathematics.
So I'd like to stop this shit.

In the beginning the objective was clear:
One topic, one page.
All rational, all focused, all clear.
I wanted to write down the principles that compromised our universe.
Though, the longer i ponder about it, the more it seems to me
there's not 'a couple of algorithms / universal truths that everybody needs to know'.
We're all living in different worlds, so what's the point
trying to explain astrophysics to someone not interested?
If there's some kind of 'universal set of things we have in common',
it's our bodies,
and if there's a 'common language across all people that everybody needs to know',
it's just the language everybody already knows.
So what's the point writing about it?
The world isn't to be found in books,
the world's outside the door.
So instead of reading this, please go out and have some fun.
Would you?

I have no mother anymore. She died the day that I couldn't bear anymore the constant fact that she was always conflicting with me.
Her existence seemed to oppose my existence.
Whatever I stated I wanted, was bad in her eyes. "Don't do that."
I have found great peace in the fact that I don't have to care about her anymore. She's a stranger to me now.
And the wounds our conflict inflicted on me is merely a memory.

And the female person that now lives in the house that I grew up in, is of my blood, and I see her as my biological mother, but I have no more emotional binding to her than to a person whom I used to know.

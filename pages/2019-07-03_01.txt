Recently talked to a biologist about what is so bad about incest.
He couldn't really explain.
So here are my thoughts:

We all know that phenomenon when we really like someone,
but sitting in the same room with them for a few hours
somehow begins to be annoying.
Silent tension is building up, and we just need to leave.
I think it's exactely the same in familiary context:
We need to leave behind what we have always known to find new horizons,
everything else is just out of balance.

=====================

(This is purely fictional, i'm sorry if i'm misrepresenting Cam Damage's views.)
(In fact, i Am misrepresenting them, as the real Cam Damage would be more talkative...)
(I'm sorry, Cam Damage, but it's really hard for me to make up your answers - i hope you can forgive me.)

Introduction

...

Me:
So, yeah, I read an interview you gave (https://thephotographicjournal.com/interviews/cam-damage/) and it really touched me. Initially, I thought it's a nice interview, but nothing special, but after a while i realized that you're not just a person, but actually a human. You know, there's this discrepancy between a person and a human: A person is a "lawful entity", so something appreciated by law, including rights that have to be respected. But a human is a living thing and has a soul, like, any computer can be a person (imagine a chatbot - behaves as a person), but you're not just a person, you're a human too. And it really moved something in me realizing that.

Actually, i think we're a lot alike. Like, you having difficulties looking into other people's eyes and stuff. I was just like that too a few years ago, so i know about it.

What's helped me was learning to understand how the world works. Like, the moment i realize how something works, i'm not scared of it anymore, i'm just afraid of it. Well... that's difficult for me to express in english (not my native language), but in german we have two words for it: Angst and Furcht. Angst is something emotionally, like when there's an explosion next to you, then in the first moment you have Angst. But as soon as you realize what it is and how to deal with it, that emotion turns into something rational (Furcht), and then it's not a feeling anymore, but a fact. Then it doesn't touch you anymore... if you know what i mean. And to me, it's just the same with people: Me realizing that that person standing a meter next to me can't actually harm me or anything takes away all of that emotion, all of that bad feeling, and suddenly i'm perfectly capable of looking into other people's eyes, because i think like "whatever happens, it's alright and i can deal with it". ... I'm not saying it can help you or anything, i'm only saying that it has helped me in the past.

Cam Damage:
And i'd like to do more stuff that i like, like portraits, but that's difficult.
Because i always feel that it's on the edge of pleasing the audience and expressing what i want to... which might differ a bit.

Me:
Yeah i imagine it's really hard to "not lose your soul" while opening up your "real self" to a broader audience... you always make yourself vulnerable when you do so.

I'd like to tell you that i'm totally supporting you when you do stuff that you like.

Cam Damage:
Thanks.

Me:
Still that doesn't get you much money.

...

So, yeah, i too started being interested in you because of your really sexy pictures, like your latex stuff... So it's totally understandable that that's a real factor... And the agencies are difficult. Because the agencies seek just that.

Though i wouldn't blame to agencies neither the models working there... they're just a mirror of how society wants stuff to look like. They're just expressing society's idealized views, sothat these become visible. Ofc, we could say "let's suppress all that sexualizing agencies", but that still would only hide away the people's desired ideals. It wouldn't change them. I think by publicly exposing our ideals, only then we can reflect about them and learn to understand them. So actually i'm glad that there's so much sexualized material on the internet, because that way i can think about it. Like, it took me hundreds, if not thousands, of these pictures to think like "why am i actually doing this? it ain't making me any happier long-term". If i'd never had that experience, i'd probably still spend my days trying to fetch girls into my bed.

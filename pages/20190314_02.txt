Probably puberty is the time to explore one's sexuality,
and probably many people at this age are to afraid to do so.
Which is sad and leaves traces, as these people never quite show the self-esteem they ought to have.
On the other hand, one could note that it's those people's own fault:
Being afraid of something always comes at a price.

Now I do think that the only true antidote to fear is enlightenment:
Fear is an irrationality that stems from a lack of understanding the situation.

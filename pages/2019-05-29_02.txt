Thoughts about LISP
===================

In IT there's a concept called "Symbolic Programming",
and it's about processing code (not "ordinary" data).
It's about reflection (the ability to inspect oneself)
and the equivalence of code and data.

In Symbolic Programming, you can, for example,
pass some expression as an argument to a function,
and the expression is not evaluated to data, but passed as-is to the function.
This is *not a special feature*,
but in fact *the core feature* of symbolic programming.

LISP, then, to me is nothing more than the most beautiful way
to express Symbolic Programming, and subsequently the equivalence
of code and data.

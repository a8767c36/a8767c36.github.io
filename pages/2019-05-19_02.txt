Look, if you want to get big and strong,
you gotta eat a lot.
You gotta grab those vegetables and eat them.
You gotta grab that energy and eat it.
You gotta grab that meat and, you know, eat it.

There's no animal in the world dumb enough to not know that,
so why would I be dumb enough to not know that?

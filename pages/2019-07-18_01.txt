So i recently read a book and a thing i realized while reading was that the book was really sparse with details. The author only expressed the macroscopic view on the scene, but left all details unsaid. And that, in fact, bursted imagination to fill these tiny holes in the story. So i'm actually convinced now that talking too much and trying to be more precise does not actually help people, but in fact leaving out some details might make the story more dynamic, more imaginable, more realistic.

Somebody managed to condense the above insight into three simple words:

Explanation kills Art.

And i think that's really something to meditate about.

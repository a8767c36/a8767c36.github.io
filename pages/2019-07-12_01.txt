It follows that we need to take chances
at the risk of being yelled at and coming out as a fool,
because in the end, those who call us fools
are those we can safely ignore.

And so, I, today, talked to many people
not knowing their opinions,
and always risking to make an unpleasant appearance to them.
In the end, even though there were as many people that I liked as there were that I didn't like,
I feel I made progress,
and the world looks brighter to me now.

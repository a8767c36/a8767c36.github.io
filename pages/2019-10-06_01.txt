Thoughts on WebAssembly
=======================

For those of you who have never heard of it,
WebAssembly is an exciting project dedicated to shaping the future of information technology.
The fascinating thing about WebAssembly lies in its simplicity and elegance.

In WebAssembly, two types of memory exist:
So-called "linear memory" (which is basically a byte array),
and a "symbol table" (which is basically an array of symbols).
Nothing outside of that memory can be accessed directly.
I say "directly" because symbols can act as doors, or as keys to an outer world.
(And if they act as doors, we call them "functions", and if they act as keys, we call them "permissions".)

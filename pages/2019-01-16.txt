When we let ourselves fall into the darkness, that is when we are free.
When we don't know, and we act, that is when we feel alive.
When we are alone, and we meet someone. That is a party.
I imagine all of this happening right here, in this place, tonight.
That is the feeling that I live for.
That is freedom.
That is love.

You know that feeling when you switch on the computer to write something,
but it takes so long, when it's ready you forgot what you wanted to write?
Because I do.
Seriously.
Software's supposed to be faster than old-fashioned pen & paper.
Who the heck makes software this bloated anyway that it takes ages to even start??
There are some important guidelines that apply to natural spoken language as well as software:
Say exactely what makes sense, not more, not less. Say it in the simplest goddamn way possible.
If you can follow this, you can't fail. Ever.
And the software can NEVER be bloated enough to take ages to start.

You know how spoken language is targeted, rational?
Spoken language is to express ideas, not emotions.
And nobody's ever had two good ideas at once.
(Because the relevant part of the brain is single-threaded.)
